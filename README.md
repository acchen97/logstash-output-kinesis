# Kinesis Output Plugin

[![Build Status][badge-travis]][travis]
[![Gem info][badge-gem]][rubygems]

This is a plugin for [Logstash](https://github.com/elasticsearch/logstash).

It will send log records to a [Kinesis stream](https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/), using the [KPL](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/dev/developing-producers-with-kpl.html) library.


## Configuration

Minimum required configuration to get this plugin chugging along:

```
output {
  kinesis {
    stream_name => "logs-stream"
    region => "ap-southeast-2"
  }
}
```

This plugin accepts a wide range of configuration options, most of which come from the underlying KPL library itself. [View the full list of KPL configuration options here.][kpldoc]

Please note that configuration options are snake_cased instead of camelCased. So, where [KinesisProducerConfiguration][kpldoc] offers a `setMetricsLevel` option,this plugin accepts a `metrics_level` option.

### AWS Credentials

There aren't many Kinesis streams out there that allow you to write to them without some AWS credentials.

This plugin does not allow you to specify credentials directly. Instead, the AWS SDK [DefaultAWSCredentialsProviderChain](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaSDK/latest/javadoc/com/amazonaws/auth/DefaultAWSCredentialsProviderChain.html) is used. It's quite flexible,you can provide your credentials via any of the following mechanisms:

 * `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` / `AWS_SECRET_KEY` environment variables
 * `~/.aws/credentials` credentials file
 * Instance profile for your running EC2 instance

### Building a partition key

Kinesis demands a [partition key](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/dev/key-concepts.html#partition-key) be provided for each record. By default, this plugin will provide a very boring partition key of `-`. However, you can configure it to compute a partition key from fields in your log events.

```
output {
  kinesis {
    # ...
    event_partition_keys => ["[field1]", "[field2]"]
  }
}
```


## Known Issues

### Noisy shutdown

During shutdown of Logstash, you might get noisy warnings like this:

```
[pool-1-thread-6] WARN com.amazonaws.services.kinesis.producer.Daemon - Exception during updateCredentials
java.lang.InterruptedException: sleep interrupted
at java.lang.Thread.sleep(Native Method)

```

This is caused by [amazon-kinesis-producer#10](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-producer/issues/10)


## Developing

Ensure you have JRuby 1.7.x installed. [rvm](https://rvm.io/) is your friend :)

```sh
bundle install
bundle exec rake
```

### Updating KPL

Change the dependency version in `build.gradle`, and then run `gradle copylibs`. Make sure to check in all the updated JARs! Yes, we put them in the repo :(

Are more than welcome. Raising an issue is great, raising a PR is better, raising a PR with tests is best.
